# Applied Data Science Capstone: SpaceX Launch Prediction and Analysis

This project demonstrates the application of data science techniques using the SpaceX launch dataset. The goal is to predict the success or failure of a SpaceX launch based on historical data, as well as to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and build an interactive dashboard to visualize the results.

## Project Overview

The project is structured into the following main components:

1. *Data Collection*: 
   - The SpaceX dataset is collected from various sources and APIs, containing details about the launches, rocket configurations, and success/failure outcomes.
   
2. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*:
   - Data cleaning and preprocessing are done to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
   - Visualizations are created to explore relationships between variables and identify trends, such as launch success rates by rocket type or location.

3. *Predictive Modeling*:
   - Machine learning models, including Logistic Regression and Random Forest, are applied to predict the outcome of a launch.
   - The models are trained using historical data, with features like launch site, rocket type, and weather conditions, to predict the success or failure of future launches.

4. *Dashboard*:
   - An interactive web dashboard is built using Flask/Dash to allow users to interact with the data and visualize launch success predictions.
   - The dashboard includes charts, filters, and real-time predictions for upcoming launches.

## Tools & Technologies

- *Python*: For data manipulation, modeling, and analysis.
- *Jupyter Notebooks*: For performing data exploration, model building, and analysis.
- *Pandas & NumPy*: For data cleaning and manipulation.
- *Scikit-learn*: For machine learning model building.
- *Matplotlib & Seaborn*: For data visualization.
- *Flask/Dash*: For creating the interactive web dashboard.
- *SQL*: For querying structured data when necessary.

## Key Features

- *Data Preprocessing*: Handles missing values, removes duplicates, and standardizes the data for further analysis.
- *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*: Analyzes the launch success/failure rate and the factors that influence the outcome.
- *Machine Learning Models*: Implements algorithms like Logistic Regression and Random Forest for predictive analysis of launch success.
- *Visualization*: Visualizes key metrics like launch success rates, success by rocket type, and other factors influencing launch outcomes.
- *Interactive Dashboard*: A user-friendly web application for visualizing and interacting with the data and predictions.
